Git Intro Activity==================A. Form teams-------------Form a 2-person team. Try to find someone who uses the same platform as you (e.g., Windows, Linux, etc.). If you can't, that's fine. If you are the odd-person-out, join a team of 2.Complete the exercises below, and fill in your answers in the spaces provided below each question.Once you have completed all the exercises and filled in this file with your answers, add this file to your Lab 9 directory (which you will create in section G) and push it to your team repo.This file is the deliverable for this lab, so make sure you do not forget to push it at the end!1.  List your team members below.    ```Chris ClaytonCatherine Castagna    ```D. Getting help---------------Run the following commands.    git help    git help -ag    git help init1.  What does `git help` do?    ```git help displays common git commands with their descriptions	    ```2.  What does `-ag` cause `git help` to do?    ```-ag causes git help to display subcommands and concept guides    ```G. Basic commands-----------------Open the terminal. Navigate to your team’s repository directory.Create a directory inside of your team repository which will act as your submission directory for this lab.The directory should be named according to the last names of your team members following the format below.    <member1LastName>_<member2LastName>_Lab9Use a plain text editor to create `names.txt` inside the directory you just created.Put the names of your team in the file. Save and exit.Run `git status` before and after each of these commands.    git add names.txt    git commit –m “Add our names.”    git log1.  What kind of information does `git status` report?    ```git status provides information about differences between the local and shared/remote repositories    ```2.  What does `git add names.txt` do?    ```git add names.txt adds the names.txt file to the list of changes to keep when pushing (instead of checkout)    ```3.  What does `git commit -m "Add our names."` do?    ```git commit -m "Add our names." accepts the list of added changes and prepares them to be pushed/committed, with the message/comment "Add our names.".    ```Use a plain text editor to create the following files:-   `birthdays.txt` - Put your birthdays in this file. (you are not obligated to use real information here)-   `movies.txt` - Put the last movie each of you watched in alphabetical order.Run `git status` before and after each of these commands.    git add .    git commit		Note:  Commit will open the vim editor; write a multi-line commit						   message, save and quit (press esc and then type :wq).    git log4.  What does `git add .` do? What do you think `.` means?    ```git add . adds both files to the list of accepted changes. The . means "add all changes in the current directory".    ```5.  What does `git commit` (without -m) do?    ```git commit (without -m) commits the files and creates and opens a file in the default text editor for the commit message.    ```6.  If you want to write a more detailed commit message (which is    good practice) what command would you use?    ```One would use git commit (without -m) to write a more detailed message, because it opens the entire commit message file in the default text editor.    ```7.  What does `git log do`?    ```git log displays all the commits and messages made to the repository in the current directory.    ```H. Stage/Cache/Index--------------------Do the following:-   Modify `names.txt` so that names are listed in *Last, First* format,    one per line.-   Modify `movies.txt` so they are in reverse alphabetical order    by title.-   Create a new file `foods.txt` that contains your favorite foods (one    for each team member).Run the following commands:    git add names.txt    git status1.  Below write each file name under the state that its changes are    currently in. Compose a definition for each state.    **Staged**    ```names.txtFiles added to the list be committed    ```    **Unstaged**    ```movies.txtFiles not yet added to the commit list, but edited since last commit    ```    **Untracked**    ```Files created since last commit that have not been added to the commit list    ```1.  If you run `git commit` what changes will be committed (***DON’T DO IT***)?    ```names.txt    ```2.  What command do you run to stage changes?    ```git add <file> OR git add .    ```3.  What command do you run to unstage changes?    ```git reset HEAD <file>    ```Run the following commands:    git diff    git diff --cached1.  What does `git diff` display?    ```git diff displays differences in unstaged files in the remote and local repositories, providing information on deletions vs editions, etc.    ```2.  What does `git diff --cached` display?    ```git diff --cached displays differences in staged files in the remote and local repositories, providing information on deletions vs editions, etc.    ```3.  Formulate a sequence of commands to unstage changes to `names.txt`,    and stage the changes to `movies.txt`. Execute your commands and    confirm they worked.    ```git reset HEAD names.txtgit add movies.txt    ```4.  Edit `movies.txt`, change any one of the movies, and save it. Then    run `git status`. What do you observe? Explain what you think is    going on.    ```movies.txt is listed in both staged and unstaged.  This is because the file staged for commit is the one prior to replacing one of the movie names.  The file in unstaged is the edited movie.txt file.    ```5.  Delete `names.txt`. Then run `git status`. What do you observe?    Explain what you think is going on.    ```The status for names.txt under unstaged is "deleted" (was previously "modified").  Git recognizes that the file no longer exists    ```6.  Rename `movies.txt` to `last-movies`. Run `git status`. Observe    and explain.    ```The status of movies.txt in the unstaged list is now "deleted" and a new file, last-movies.txt has appeared in the untracked list.  Git treats renaming a file as deletion of the file with the old file name and creation of a new file of the new name.    ```7.  Formulate a sequence of commands to stage all changes including the    untracked file and commit (with any reasonable message you like).    Execute them.    ```git add .git statusgit commit(multi-line message)    ```8.  In git vernacular, `index`, `cache`, and `stage` all refer to the    same thing. What does it hold?    ```It holds all of the files that have been queued for the next commit.    ```9.  Why have a `stage`? Why not just commit all changes since the last    commit?    ```It is safer to have a stage and check for differences before committing all changes (prevents conflicts).    ```I. Undo-------Run the following commands:    git log    git status    git reset --soft "HEAD^"    git log    git status1.  What does `git reset --soft ``"HEAD^" `do?    ```git reset --soft "HEAD^" undoes the last commit and removes the last log, but retains changes made to files.    ```Run the following commands:    git commit –m "Redo."    git log    git status    git reset --hard "HEAD^"    git log    git status1.  What does `git reset --hard ``"HEAD^"`` `do?    ```git reset --hard "HEAD^" undoes the last commit and removes the last log, and resets all files to previous commit's state.    ```2.  What is the difference between `--hard` and `--soft`?    ```--hard resets all files to the previous commit's state, while --soft retains changes made to files.    ```3.  What do you think `HEAD` means?    ```HEAD means last commit performed.    ```4.  What do you think `HEAD^` means?    ```HEAD^ references the commit previous to the last performed commit.    ```J.
